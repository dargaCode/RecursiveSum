# Recursive Sum
<strong>Language: C</strong>

Recursively sums a series of numbers up to a given max, with an optional nonzero minimum.

Before I work on merge sort (which is recursive), Iâ€™m going to redo a few of my JavaScript scratchpads in C.

The summing itself is easy, but it was interesting to handle a single argument (max) or two arguments (min and max) from the user.
